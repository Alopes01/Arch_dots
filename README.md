Hello, fellow Linux enthusiasts!

Welcome to my Arch Linux i3WM configuration repository. This is where the magic happens! I've customized my setup to be as efficient, aesthetic, and minimalist as possible—perfect for getting work done and looking good while doing it. Whether you're looking for inspiration for your own rice or just curious about how my machine is configured, you've come to the right place.

**Note:** Some configurations, like those for Rofi and Neofetch, are adapted from other amazing projects. I've credited the original sources in the relevant config files.
